# PowerShellRunner
It is a kind of executable to run PowerShell file in an easy way.

## How it works
Just rename the PowerShellRunner.exe to the same name of your PowerShell script file (.ps1),
put it in the same folder, and run the new renamed .exe file and it will run the PowerShell script, ex:

For c:\test\Sample.ps1
* Put a copy of PowerShellRunner.exe in c:\test
* Rename PowerShellRunner.exe to Sample.exe
* Run the c:\test\Sample.exe
